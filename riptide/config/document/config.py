        proxy
            url: str
                Base-URL for the proxy server. The name of projects and/or services will be appended to it.

                For example `projectname.riptide.local` would route to the
                project `projectname` if `riptide.local` is specified.

                http: int

                https: Or[int,bool]
                    HTTPS port that the proxy server should listen on, or false to disable HTTPS

            autostart: bool
                Whether or not the proxy server should auto-start all services for a project
                if a user enters the URL for a service.

            [autostart_restrict]: List[str]
                If set, only the IPv4 ip addresses specified by the netmasks in this list are allowed
                to trigger the auto-start process via the proxy server. For other clients, projects
                are not automatically started. Useful if you share a network with co-workers and don't
                want them to start your projects.

            [compression]: bool
                If true, the proxy server doesn't decompress any data, and instead passes the compressed
                data of the backend server (if compressed). Experimental.

        engine: str
            Engine to use, the Python package for the engine must be installed.

        repos: List[str]
            List of URLs to Git repositories containing
            `Riptide Repositories </config_docs/using_repo/how_repositories.html>`_.

        update_hosts_file: Or[bool,str]
            Whether or not Riptide should automatically update the
            `system's host file </user_docs/3_installing.html#resolving-hostnames-permissions-for-the-etc-hosts-file>`_.

            This may be set to string, in which case the string must be a path to a hosts file to update. If it
            is set to `true`, the system's default hosts file is updated.

        [project]: :class:`~riptide.config.document.project.Project`
            If a project is loaded, Riptide inserts the project here. Do not manually insert a project
            into the actual system configuration file.

        performance
            Various performance optimizations that, when enabled, increase the performance
            of containers, but might have some other drawbacks.

            Values can be true/false/auto.
            "auto" enables an optimization, if beneficial on your platform.

            dont_sync_named_volumes_with_host: Or['auto',bool]
                If enabled, volumes, that have a volume_name set, are not mounted to the host system
                and are instead created as volumes with the volume_name. Otherwise they
                are created as host path volumes only. Enabling this increases
                performance on some platforms.

                Please note, that Riptide does not delete named volume data for old projects.
                Please consult the documentation of the engine, on how to do that.

                "auto" enables this feature on Mac and Windows, when using the Docker
                container backend.

                Switching this setting on or off breaks existing volumes. They need to be
                migrated manually.

            dont_sync_unimportant_src: Or['auto', bool]
                Normally all Commands and Services get access to the entire source
                directory of a project as volume. If this setting is enabled,
                ``unimportant_paths`` that are defined in the App are not updated
                on the host system when changed by the volume. This means changes
                to these files are not available, but file access speeds may be
                drastically increased on some platforms.

                "auto" enables this feature on Mac and Windows, when using the Docker
                container backend.

                This feature can be safely switched on or off. Projects need to be
                restarted for this to take effect.
