        [unimportant_paths]: List[str]
            Normally all files inside containers are shared with the host (for commands and services with role 'src').
            This list specifies files that don't need to be synced with the host. This means, that these files
            will only be uploaded to the container on start and changes will not be visible on the host. Changes that
            are made on the host file system may also not be visible inside the container. This increases performance
            on non-native platforms (Mac and Windows).

            This feature is only enabled if the system configuration performance setting ``dont_sync_unimportant_src``
            is enabled. If the feature is disabled, all files are shared with the host. See the documentation for that
            setting for more information.

            All paths are relative to the src of the project. Only directories are supported.
