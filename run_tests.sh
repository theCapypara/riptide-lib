## RUN TESTS (Linux only)
#
# This will run all tests in this project, including the engine integration tests with the Docker engine backend.
# The tests are run on Python versions 3.11 - 3.x.
# See tox.ini for details :)
#
# For these tests to run, you need to have Docker installed. The tests will use a Docker image found in
#   test_assets/riptide-docker-tox
# to run the tests. The tests will be given access to your Docker daemon.
#
# FOR MAC AND WINDOWS TESTS:
#   Run the commands in the tox.ini on their own (after installing everything).
#   Testing multiple Python versions not supported on these platforms.
#
# If you have problems, try to delete the .tox directory.
